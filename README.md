## Why?

Building an online store usually means wrestling with complicated code for days? I wanted to change that.

So I created [Next Shopify Storefront](https://github.com/VienDinhCom/next-shopify-storefront)—basically, it's a starter
kit that lets you build a Shopify store incredibly fast. Think of it as a foundation that's already solid, so you can
focus on what makes your store unique instead of reinventing the wheel.

Here's what I'm talking about: it uses Next.js and React for the framework,
[TailwindCSS](https://github.com/VienDinhCom/esmate/tree/main/packages/shadcn) and
[ShadCN](https://github.com/VienDinhCom/esmate/tree/main/packages/shadcn) to make things look great, and connects
directly to Shopify's backend through their
[GraphQL API](https://shopify.dev/docs/storefronts/headless/building-with-the-storefront-api/api-exploration/graphiql-storefront-api).
The shopping cart? Built with [Shopify Hydrogen React](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@shopify/hydrogen-react).

But the part I'm most proud of is the developer experience. Everything's
configured—[ESMate](https://github.com/VienDinhCom/esmate),
[ESLint](https://github.com/VienDinhCom/esmate/tree/main/packages/eslint),
[Prettier](https://github.com/VienDinhCom/esmate/tree/main/packages/prettier),
[GraphQL Codegen](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@graphql-codegen/cli)—so the code stays clean and safe automatically.

It's not revolutionary. It's just taking what works and packaging it so you can skip the tedious setup and start
building something meaningful.
